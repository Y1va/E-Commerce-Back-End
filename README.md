## Description

This application is an E-Commerce Back-End, my task was to modify current existing code and to add to it making it possible to test my api routes. This app utilises sequelize to interact with the MySQL database as well as showing how the APIs work with Express routing demonstrated through Insomnia. 

## Demo
